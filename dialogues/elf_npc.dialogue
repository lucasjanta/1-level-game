Elf King: [[Hi|Hello|Greetings]] stranger. I am the Elf King, ruler of this village.
Elf King: Tell me, who are you and what brings you here?
- I'm just looking for fun with the ladies!
    Elf King: Ohoho... Quite bold, aren't you? Unfortunately, this is not that kind of village. Please leave.
- I'm a traveler looking for a nice place to shop.
    Elf King: Hmm... If you truly wish to help our economy...
    Elf King: I suppose I can let you pass.
