Father: Hm? You look like you've got something to say, traveler.  
- Are you the father of a young girl back in the village? She’s worried sick!  
- I think I met your daughter... she was terrified being alone.
    Father: Ah, my little one... Yes, yes, that's my daughter.  
    Father: I know I’ve been gone for two days, but you see... I’m an adventurer!  
    Father: Out there, fighting monsters, risking my life to bring gold and food to her table!  
    - Adventurer, huh? Then why can I smell booze all the way from here?  
    - Risking your life? Smells to me like you've been risking your liver.  
        Father: W-Whaaat? No, no, that’s just... a new monster repellent I’m testing! Smells like ale, very effective.  
        - Sure... Sounds more like you’ve been drinking nonstop. 
            Father: ...Okay, okay, maybe I had a drink. Or two. Or... ten.  
            Father: But hey, life as an adventurer is stressful!  
            - Your daughter was so worried she screamed at me when I... uh... accidentally walked into your house.  
                Father: YOU WHAT?!  
                Father: Wait, wait, let me get this straight... you broke into my home, scared my daughter,  
                Father: and now you’re here judging ME for having a drink?  
                - Hey, I’m just saying you should go back before she calls the guards on us both!  
                - Look, she misses you, just go home before this gets worse.  
                    Father: ...Fair point.  
                    Father: Alright, I'm heading home right now.  
                    Father: I’ll never leave my daughter alone again...  
                    Father: And I’ll make sure to lock the door from now on. 
                    Father: Too many lunatics wandering into houses these days... *glares at you*
